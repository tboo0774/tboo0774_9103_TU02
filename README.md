# Week 8 Quiz 

## Part 1
The imaging technique that I intend to use as an inspiration for the final assignment is animating 3D rectangles into a wave form. Such technique is used by the artist Bees and Bombs, which can be seen in the following artwork:

This technique would help me to reinterpret, dissect, reconstruct the artwork in the form of 3D blocks, which can then be animated using the time-based method. Artworks that could work well with this techniques are those of geometric style, such as 'untitled-1' by Nasreen Mohamedi, 'Wheels of fortume' by Pacita Abad, and 'Broadway Boogie Woogie' by Piet Mondrian.

## Part 2
The coding technique that could assist in implementing the abovementioned imaging technique is demonstrated by Dan Shiffman on The Coding Train website (Links below). The technique uses p5.js and Web Graphics Library to generate animated wave of 3D rectangles. In this code example, WEBGL renderer allows for the creation and manipulation of 3D shapes, which are created by calling the box() function inherent in p5.js. The height of the shapes from the box() function is oscillated by mapping a sine wave function and offset in a nested FOR loop, which produces a 'wave-like' effect. Inside the loop, the 'angle' variable is updated at each iteration to make the 3D shapes move up and down continuously.
